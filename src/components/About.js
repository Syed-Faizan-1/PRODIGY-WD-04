                Hello! I am an undergraduate Computer Scientist. I was born in October 2002 in Lahore, Pakistan. I am
                very passionate about developing full-stack applications. I was always interested in Computer
                Science and rightly so, it remained my field from Matriculation to Intermediate and in the
                university as well. Graduated in BSCS from PUCIT (FCIT), University of Punjab.
